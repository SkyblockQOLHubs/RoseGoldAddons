### What it does:

This mod offers more then every other cheat.
It offers the most high quality features on the market FOR FREE

### How to use it?
The command to open the GUI is /RGA, everything else is pretty self explanatory

### Is this bannable?
This mod is banable in terms of breaking rules, BUT due to a ton of fail safes and such it is very unlickely that you will be banned.

### Features
Most notable features: (all auras and nukers use fake rotation packets) 
Qol ice fill (still somewhat wip, works great for 150 or less ping) 
Spirit Bear Aura (with triggerbot once a spirit bear spawns) 
Simon Says Aura -Good Terminals -Mithril Macro -Gemstone Macro (still wip) 
Nuker (good to use on hypixel) 
Powder Macro (everything automatic, uses nuker for the block breaking) 
Crop Aura (auto places any crop)

All macros have failsafes, for example player detection or stop when getting warped out -Auto Enchanting -Auto Book Combine -Auto Salvage -Shoot terminator when left clicking with valk -Gemstone ESP -Hide Golden Goblins -Powder Chest Macro (there's also a mode to only use fake rotation to solve it) -Item Keybinds -Commission Esps -Alot of dungeon Esps -Auto Wardrobe -Anti sessionid stealer (works for getSessionID and getToken, still somewhat WIP?)

There's still a shit ton more features, like a shit ton of esps and shit, but i cba mentioning them
